      const original = `# Cairo Programming Guide

Welcome to the Cairo programming guide. This document covers the basics.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cairo, you need to understand the fundamentals.

### Installation

First, install the Cairo compiler:

\`\`\`bash
curl -L https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo/releases/download/v2.0.0/cairo-lang-2.0.0.tar.gz | tar xz
cd cairo-lang-2.0.0
./install.sh
\`\`\`

### Your First Program

Here's a simple Cairo program:

\`\`\`cairo
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let y = 2;
    assert(x + y == 3, 'Math is broken!');
}
\`\`\`

## Advanced Topics

Once you understand the basics, you can explore advanced features.

### Memory Management

Cairo uses a unique memory model based on field elements.

### Smart Contracts

You can write smart contracts in Cairo for StarkNet.

## Conclusion

Cairo is a powerful language for writing provable programs.`;
